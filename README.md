# ECO-726-Replication-Project--Main Results&Extension

<ins>Included in this folder:</ins>
- General-
.dta file

- Replication-
.do file and
.log file

**Note: you left me feedback on my previous replication assignment about running some commands "quietly" so I don't have so much crowdedness in my .log file. I tried that, but did not like how concise it suddenly came out. There were no tables, but rather only one line outputs that gave you "Variable:estimate SE: ___ N: ____". I'm not sure if there is a middle ground where I can continue to have the tables produced with more minimal results. But thought to let you know that I did attempt this!** 

**NOTE: FILE PATH WILL HAVE TO BE CHANGED FOR STATA REPLICATION**

- Extension-
.py file and
.ipynb file (which also links to Google Colab)
